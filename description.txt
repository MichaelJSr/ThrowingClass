	This is a mod meant to allow you to use the throwing class in hardmode, as well as adding items for it in pre-hardmode! Currently, the items inside of this mod are:

- 3 rebalanced sets of armor (gladiator, obsidian, and viking)
- 1 new throwing projectile
- 1 new throwing launcher

	Also, the mod adds set bonuses to the gladiator, obsidian, and viking sets; the set bonuses are:

Gladiator Armor (16 defense overall):
- 10% increased meelee and throwing critical strike chance.
- 10% increased meelee and throwing damage.

Obsidian Armor (13 defense overall):
- 10% increased movement speed.
- 10% increased throwing damage.

Viking Armor (Not implemented yet):
- 15% increased meelee and throwing damage.

Javelins:
- Javelins are now ammo, and can be used in the Javelin launcher and Stake launcher.

Clothier:
- The clothier now sells javelins (will probably be changed in the future if I decide to add a custom npc)

	Here are the stats of each item, starting with the throwing projectiles;

Throwing Projectiles:

- Javelin Launcher:
	- 25 damage (adds onto the javelins damage similarly to ammo)
	- Throwing Damage modifiers
	- 25 use time
	- Adds 4 to the velocity of the javelins fired

	Crafted at any anvil:
	- 1 Illegal gunparts

	=
	- 1 Javelin Launcher

- Hellfire Javelin:
	- 50 damage
	- Throwing Damage modifiers
	- 25 use time
	- Explosive (AOE) damage
	
	Crafted at a Hellforge:
		- 1 Hellstone bar
		- 70 Javelins
		=
		- 70 Hellfire Javelins

	- 999 Hellfire Javelins can be combined into an infinite Hellfire Javelin at a Hellforge.
